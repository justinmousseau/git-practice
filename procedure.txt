Our goal is to save this file to my local repository, create a new branch, add changes to the staging area of the newly created branch, commit the changes, and push those changes to the newly created branch on GitHub. Then we will switch locally to the master branch, pull changes from GitHub in case someone has made adjusments, locally merge the newly created branch to the master branch, and push the changes to the master branch on GitHub. Finally, we'll delete the newly created branch.

1.   git branch <branch name>
2.   git checkout <branch name>
3.   Make changes to code in local repository and save
4.   git status   // to confirm changes
5.   git add -A   // adds changes to staging area of the locally stored newly created branch
6.   git commit -m "<message>"
7.   git push -u origin <branch name>   // push changes to remotely stored newly created branch

8.   git branch master
9.   git pull origin master   // get changes from remote repo
10.  git merge <branch name>   // merges newly created branch to master locally
11.  git push origin master   // pushes changes to remote master

12.  git branch -d <branch name>   // delete local branch
13.  git push origin --delete <branch name>   // remove branch from remote
